## Short description
You move forward through the unfamiliar portal formed by two bended trees.  
You're immediately met by a fascinating world.  
Waterfalls pour into the lagoon you're standing in from high above.  
Light from the orange sun peeks over and warms you gently.  
The terrain's treacherous to walk on.  
Who knows what dangers await to those who fall.
